# Tetris JavaScript

As the name implies, this is a simple Tetris clone written purely in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Running the game is simple enough. First clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/IliyanVT18/Tetris-JavaScript/
```

Then `cd` into the directory:

```
cd Tetris-JavaScript
```

And from there, simply open the `index.html`  file using your preferred web browser.
